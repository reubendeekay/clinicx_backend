and Kisumu) but hoping to scale across the other major cities.The clinics are distributed in
various locations, and each branch offers a subset or all the services currently listed under
ClinicX.
You are tasked to write ClinicX software which will have below features:
1. Enable ClinicX better manage its branches across the country.
2. Avail a feature where patients can easily locate ClinicX branches.
3. Allow patients to book for the various services listed under ClinicX.
4. Generate below reports for management use:

Proposed Tools:Java && SpringBoot,Angular,PrimeNg,JasperReports,any SQL database.

Implementation Instructions
For all the tasks discussed above we will be utilizing the Software Engineering concepts
discussed in our previous session.Below is a summary:
1. To ensure code quality, all the code must have unit tests.This applies for APP,WEB and
backend components.
2. For the API based components you are expected to stress test your APIs and clearly
articulate the throughput of your endpoints i.e the number of transactions per second.
3. Since the tasks will be done in groups of about 5 students, You will be expected to
collaborate using below tools:
a. Github for code management.The repositories should be public. Usage of feature
branches will be highly encouraged.
b. ASANA for task management. Asana is free for up to 5 participants.Each group
can have its own account.

4. The groups are encouraged to have weekly code reviews.In these reviews below is
encouraged:
a. Constructive and positive feedback.
b. Suggestions on better ways of approaching a task/solution.
c. Intensive code walkthrough.
5. More instructions will be given as we proceed.
